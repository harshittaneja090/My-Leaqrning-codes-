This is when the writer is narrating an incident or story through the essay.

So these are in the first person. The aim when writing narrative essays is to involve the reader in them as 

if they were right there when it was happening.



Here the writer will describe a place, an object, an event or maybe even a memory.

But it is not just plainly describing things. The writer must paint a picture through his words.

One clever way to do that is to evoke the senses of the reader.



This is the first paragraph of your essay. 

You can give a very brief synopsis of your essay in the introductory paragraph. 

This is how  you  can improve.

Some paragraph writing skills can be a help here. Generally, it is not very long, about 4-6 lines.

This is where the writer introduces his topic for the very first time.
